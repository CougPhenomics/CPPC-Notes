# Notes for the Compact Plants Phenomics Center

June 2019 LemnaTec went out of business. A new LemnaTec was founded with all the same people in Sept 2019. Despite a visit from the CEO and some assurances they would continue to support us, they mostly don't respond to support requests. Since the new LemnaTec is a new legal entity they have no legal obligation to fullfill our service contract that we purchased with the equipment.

The information in this wiki is meant as an on-going record and to substitute for the documentation that LemanTec did not provide. Its written to the best of my knowledge but I have no access to design specs or software code so it's all trial and error.
